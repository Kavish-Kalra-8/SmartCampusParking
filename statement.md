Project Problem Statement

1. Problem Statement

Right now, parking at our university is managed manually. Security guards write down license plate numbers in a physical register. This causes a few specific problems:

It's slow: During morning rush hour, long lines form because writing details by hand takes time.

It is Unorganized : All the data is logged in a register and if it gets damaged or misplaced then all the data is lost .

It's hard to track: If a person forgets where they have parked their vehicle then there is no way to quickly find the vehicle.

Money errors: Calculating how much someone owes based on hours parked is often done wrong when done in a hurry.

This project solves these issues by moving the system to a computer, where fees are calculated automatically and data is saved permanently.

2. Scope of the Project

I am building a Core Java console application to simulate a parking lot system.

What is included (In-Scope):

Single Lot: Managing one parking area with a fixed number of slots (e.g., 10 slots for testing).

Basic Vehicles: Supporting Cars and Bikes with different parking rates.

Session Tracking: Remembering which cars are currently inside.

File Storage: The parking data is stored on text files for long term storage and access.

What is NOT included (Out-of-Scope):

Any hardware devices like cameras or sensors to track the vehicles .

A mobile app or web application which provides a proper GUI to users for interaction.

I am not using a complex database like MySQL yet (sticking to file handling).

3. Target Users

Parking Operator: The Person who manages the parking and logs the vehicles which are being parked.

Admin: The manager who wants to track the total generated by the parking lot on a daily basis. 

4. High-Level Features

Auto-Parking: You just enter the car details, and the system finds the first empty slot for you.

Search: You can type a license plate number to find exactly which slot a car is in.

Billing: When a car leaves, the system checks the time and tells you exactly how much to pay.

Update: If the operator makes a typo on a license plate, they can fix it without deleting the ticket.

History: The system keeps a log of every car that has paid and left.
